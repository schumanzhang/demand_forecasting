# Forecasting demand for a restaurant

Running a thriving local restaurant isn't always as charming as first impressions appear. There are often all sorts of unexpected troubles popping up that could hurt business.

In this project we use reservation and visitation data to predict the total number of visitors to a restaurant for future dates. This information will help restaurants be much more efficient and allow them to focus on creating an enjoyable dining experience for their customers.
